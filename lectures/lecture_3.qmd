# Turing Machines I

Previously, we used a rough idea of an algorithm to prove that computational and decision problems are equivalent.
Now we want to turn that vague idea into something we can do math over.

## The rules of an algorithm

We are going to build a mathematical model for our algorithm

ONE) The model should be as simple as possible.

Complex models allow us to skip over ideas and work, but they make it more difficult to analyse.

- What is the behaviour of a for loop in the CPU?
- What is a while loop?

These tools are convenient for writing an algorithm, but they make it harder to see what is happening underneath.

To this end - we are going to remove the idea of data types

- Our algorithms input will always be a string
- Our algorithms output will always be a string

TWO) The model should be capable of representing _anything_ an algorithm can.

If you can imagine it is something a computer can do, then our algorithm needs to be able to do it.

## Intuition

There are a few 'physical' components necessary for a simple machine

1. A place to read and write - memory
2. A location to mark what we are reading next - position
3. A place to control what is written - instructions

A tape of cells holding a single symbol

- Every cell must have some symbol, even if that symbol is 'Nothing': $\sqcup$
- If it is not empty, then it must have a symbol $a \in \Sigma$

There are an infinite number of cells, going both to the left, and to the right.

A scanner or tapehead that can read and write a symbol

A control unit with a collection of positions (states) that decide what to do

The _only_ instruction of our simple machine is the following:

In position $q_i$, if reading symbol $s_n$, go to position $q_j$, write symbol $s_m$, move the scanner to the left or right
$$ q_i, s_n \rightarrow q_j, s_m, \{ L, R \} $$

Try imagine what a collection of instructions allows us to do?

1. How might we _infinitely_ move left?
2. How might we _infinitely_ move right?
3. Is there a way to stay in the same cell infinitely?

Importantly, we hard wire these instructions into our machine.
The execution of an instruction is performed by a physical process.

## Creating our machine in the real world

Imagine if our tape was a long length of paper

1. A $0$ is a _single_ hole in the paper
2. A $1$ is _two_ holes in the paper
3. A $\sqcup$ is no hole on the paper

Our scanner would be a needle to punch our holes, and sewing kit to fix the holes.
